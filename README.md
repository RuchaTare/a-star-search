# A-Star Search

This repository contains the implementation of the A-Star search algorithm in Python.

## Introduction

The A-Star search algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in various applications, such as robotics, video games, and route planning. It combines the advantages of both Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy best-first search to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Features

- Implementation of the A-Star search algorithm
- Customizable heuristic function
- Support for different graph representations (e.g., adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
- Visualization of the search process

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-star-search.git `
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd a-star-search`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`
